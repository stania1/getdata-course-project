# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

#### The Course
This is done as part of the [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) course on Coursera, conducted by the Johns Hopkins University.

#### Data Source
[UCI Machine Learning Repository - Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[Direct link to the data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

#### About The Solution
Data processing is done by `run_analysis.R`. The script assumes that the data set is in the `dataset` directory relative to itself.

Steps involved in data processing and explanation on the variables can be found in the [code book](https://github.com/stania1/getdata-course-project/blob/master/CodeBook.md).
